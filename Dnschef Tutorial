1. go into /etc/resolv.conf and on the first line add "nameserver 127.0.0.1"
2. type sudo dnschef in terminal
3. on another terminal type "host -t A (webname)" and on the other terminal it should say something
4. If that works then on a new terminal type in "sudo dnschef --fakeip=(fakeip) --fakedomains=(webname)" example is: "sudo dnschef --fakeip=192.168.1.2 --fakedomains=reply.com"
TIP: Remerber to close all dnschef before starting new one by "ps -ef | grep dnschef" and then doing "kill -9 (pid)"
